# Initialization Hooks

Floci allows you to execute custom shell scripts when it starts and stops. These scripts can help set up your
environment (creating buckets, populating data, configuring resources, etc.) or tidy up during shutdown.

Hook scripts ending with `.sh` are discovered in the following directories:

- **Startup hooks** (`/etc/floci/init/start.d`) run after the HTTP server is ready and accepting connections on port 4566. This means hooks can safely make HTTP calls back to Floci (e.g. using the AWS CLI).
- **Shutdown hooks** (`/etc/floci/init/stop.d`) run during the pre-shutdown phase, while the HTTP server is still accepting connections, so hooks can make HTTP calls back to Floci (e.g. using the AWS CLI). The server only stops once all shutdown hooks have completed.

If a hook directory does not exist or contains no `.sh` scripts, Floci skips it and continues normally.
If the hook path exists but is not a directory, it is ignored.

## Execution

### Execution Environment

Hooks run:

- Inside the Floci runtime environment (same context as Floci services)
- Using the configured shell (default: `/bin/sh`)
- With access to configured services and their endpoints
- With the same environment variables as Floci

Hooks can call Floci service endpoints directly from inside the container (e.g. `http://localhost:4566`).

The published Docker images are available on Docker Hub:

- `floci/floci:latest` — native image (minimal, no apk)
- `floci/floci:latest-jvm` — JVM image (Alpine-based, has apk)
- `floci/floci:latest-aws` — JVM image with AWS CLI pre-installed

If your hooks require the AWS CLI, use one of these options:

**Option 1: Use the pre-built AWS CLI image**

```dockerfile
FROM floci/floci:latest-aws
# AWS CLI is already installed
```

**Option 2: Extend the JVM image (Alpine-based)**

```dockerfile
FROM floci/floci:latest-jvm
RUN apk add --no-cache aws-cli
```

**Option 3: Extend the JVM image with additional tools**

```dockerfile
FROM floci/floci:latest-jvm
RUN apk add --no-cache aws-cli jq curl
```

If a hook depends on additional CLI tools, make sure those tools are available in the runtime image.

### Execution Behavior

Scripts are executed:

- In **lexicographical (alphabetical) order**
- **Sequentially** (one at a time)

When execution order matters, prefix filenames with numbers such as `01-`, `02-`, and `03-`.

Execution uses a fail-fast strategy:

- If a script exits with a non-zero status, remaining hooks are not executed.
- If a script exceeds the configured timeout, it is terminated and remaining hooks are not executed.
- A startup hook failure triggers application shutdown.
- A shutdown hook failure is logged but does not prevent the shutdown from completing.

## Examples

The following examples assume the runtime image includes the AWS CLI and that Floci is reachable at
`http://localhost:4566`.

### Startup Hook

For example, a startup hook could look like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 \
  ssm put-parameter \
  --name /demo/app/bootstrapped \
  --type String \
  --value true \
  --overwrite
```

This example assumes the script is stored at `/etc/floci/init/start.d/01-seed-parameter.sh`.
It seeds a known SSM parameter during startup so tests or local services can rely on it.

### Shutdown Hook

For example, a shutdown hook could look like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu

aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566 \
  ssm delete-parameter \
  --name /demo/app/bootstrapped
```

This example assumes the script is stored at `/etc/floci/init/stop.d/01-cleanup-parameter.sh`.
It removes the parameter during shutdown to leave the environment clean.

!!! note "Shutdown timing"
    Shutdown hooks run before the HTTP server stops, so Floci's total shutdown time
    grows by the cumulative runtime of all stop hooks. Make sure external orchestrator
    grace periods accommodate this (e.g. Kubernetes `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`,
    Docker Compose `stop_grace_period`).

## Configuration

You can customize hook behavior via configuration:

| Key                                              | Default     | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `floci.init-hooks.shell-executable`              | `/bin/sh`   | Shell executable used to run scripts                                                                             |
| `floci.init-hooks.timeout-seconds`               | `30`        | Maximum execution time per script before it is terminated and considered failed                                  |
| `floci.init-hooks.shutdown-grace-period-seconds` | `2`         | Time to wait after calling `destroy()` before forcefully stopping the process (allows cleanup hooks to complete) |

### Example

The following configuration can be useful when startup hooks perform more in-depth setup work, such as seeding test 
data or provisioning resources before an integration test suite starts.

```yaml
floci:
  init-hooks:
    shell-executable: /bin/sh
    timeout-seconds: 60
    shutdown-grace-period-seconds: 10
```

In this example:

- `shell-executable` uses `/bin/sh` for portable POSIX-compatible scripts.
- `timeout-seconds: 60` gives startup hooks more time to complete initialization tasks.
- `shutdown-grace-period-seconds: 10` gives shutdown hooks more time to finish cleanup before Floci stops.
